# Thinking
First, I want to explore how to make lines using for loop. 

1. two sets of x and y: x1 y1 x2 y2
2. use for loop to connect each pair

# 1st try
Okay, I overthought in my first attempt. I thought of a for loop this complicated:
  // for (let number = 0; number <= 25; number += 1){
  //   for (let x1pos = random(5,500); x1pos <= width; xpos += random(5,500)){
  //     for (let y1pos = random(5,500); y1pos <= height; ypos += random(5,500)){
  //       for (let x2pos = random(5,500); x2pos <= width; x2pos += random(5,500)){
  //         for (let y2pos = random(5,500); y2pos <= width; y2pos += random(5,500)){
  //           line(x1pos, y1pos, x2pos, y2pos)
  //         }
  //       }
  //     }
      
  // } //each set of points for 25 times
  // }

  Here was what I got:

To start a new line, add two spaces at the end of a line, like this:
